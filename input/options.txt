* in code. We always use only 4 chebyshev polynomials as basis,
* (T0, T1, T2, T3). However, it can be used to signal
* the CPU code to use different continuation functions:
* 	- 0 : Use black-Scholes continuation criteria
*	- 1 : Use of LSM as continuation criteria
* Note that this parameter value should always be less than 5.
